# sql-challenge

Background:

It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

Data modeling was done using quickdatabasediagrams and was utlized to identify and potray relationships between the csv files/tables that would go in the database. Data types, foreign and primary keys were defined to increase efficiency when creating tables and running queries in PostgreSQL.

Data engineering was the creation of the tables in the employees database that was used throughout the assignment. Using the schema and diagram created in the data modeling section, the tables can be made and data imported via CSV file into each table.

Finally, the data analysis was utilizing queries to create new tables to filter and gather specific information regarding the employees such as what departments each belong to, salary, etc.
